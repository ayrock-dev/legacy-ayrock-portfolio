                <h2>Redesign of Company Website</h2>
                <p>Among numerous other things, at PulaTech I redesigned the company website. Some bullets from my resume define my role on this project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Led front-end website redesign of pulatech.com. Drove new web features, content, and updates to production. Company website design implemented by team on CMS platform.</li>
                    <li>Organized and implemented SEO tactics alongside Google Analytics to increase website traffic 5-fold.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    On the website all primary development was done myself using my favorite web dev stack: Node.js, Gulp.js task runners, Node Project Manager, and SASS stylesheets - all written in my favorite lightweight code editors like VS Code or Sublime Text. Design elements were also done myself. All styles, colors, layouts, animations, graphics, and typography.
                </p>
                <p>As the site design has changed since my work at PulaTech, below is a video of the home page.</p>
